            <p>Arthur C. Clarke, in full Sir Arthur Charles Clarke, (born December 16, 1917, Minehead, Somerset, England—died March 19,
            2008, Colombo, Sri Lanka), English writer, notable for both his science fiction and his nonfiction. His best known works
            are the script he wrote with American film director Stanley Kubrick for 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) and the novel of
            that film.</p>

            <p>Clarke was interested in science from childhood, but he lacked the means for higher education. In 1934 he joined the
            British Interplanetary Society (BIS), a small advanced group that advocated the development of rocketry and human space
            exploration. He worked as a government auditor from 1936 to 1941. From 1941 to 1946 Clarke served in the Royal Air
            Force, becoming a radar instructor and technician. In 1945 he wrote an article entitled “Extra-Terrestrial Relays” for
            Wireless World. The article envisioned a communications satellite system that would relay radio and television signals
            throughout the world; this system was in operation two decades later. He began selling short stories in 1946 to science
            fiction magazines in the United States and Britain. Clarke was chairman of the BIS from 1946 to 1947 and from 1951 to
            1953.</p>
            <br>
            <p>
            In 1948 Clarke secured a bachelor of science degree from King’s College in London. His first nonfiction books were
            Interplanetary Flight (1950) and The Exploration of Space (1951). His first novels were routine stories of space
            exploration: Prelude to Space (1951), about the first flight to the Moon; The Sands of Mars (1951), about the
            colonization of that planet; and Islands in the Sky (1952), set on a space station.</p>

        <div id="biography2">     
            Clarke’s next novel, Childhood’s End (1953), is regarded as one of his best and dealt with how first contact with aliens
            sparks an evolutionary transformation in humanity. As humanity is about to make its first flights into space, the alien
            Overlords arrive in gigantic spaceships. The Overlords have come to Earth to foster humanity’s union with the Overmind,
            a galaxy-wide intelligence. Decades after the Overlords’ arrival, the children of Earth begin to develop psychic powers,
            merge into a group intelligence, and, as humanity’s last generation, join with the Overmind. Clarke would return to the
            themes of first contact and evolutionary leaps throughout his career.</p><br>
            <p>In the 1950s Clarke wrote two short stories that became science fiction classics. In “The Nine Billion Names of God”
            (1953), a Tibetan monastery buys a computer to finish its centuries-long task of compiling the possible names of God. In
            the Hugo Award-winning “The Star” (1955), an expedition to a distant planet finds the ruins of a civilization that was
            destroyed when its star went supernova. A Jesuit priest on the expedition has his faith tested when he discovers that
            the supernova was the Star of Bethlehem.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Clarke developed an interest in undersea exploration and moved to Sri Lanka in 1956, where he embarked on a second
            career combining skin diving and photography. He produced a succession of books, the first of which was The Coast of
            Coral (1956). That same year, he expanded an earlier novel, Against the Fall of Night (1953), as The City and the Stars.
            One billion years in the future in one of Earth’s final cities, Diaspar, a young man, Alvin, rebels against the static
            computer-controlled status quo and escapes to find out the true history of humanity and its place in the universe.</p> <br>
            <p>Beginning in 1964, Clarke worked with director Stanley Kubrick on adapting Clarke’s short story “The Sentinel” (1951)
            into a movie, which eventually became the hugely successful 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968). The film begins with prehuman
            apes encountering an alien monolith that sparks a technological and intellectual leap, the first tools. The action jumps
            forward to 2001, when another monolith is excavated on the Moon and sends a transmission to Jupiter. A spaceship, the
            Discovery, is sent to Jupiter, but the two astronauts Frank Poole (Gary Lockwood) and Dave Bowman (Keir Dullea) are
            caught in a battle for their lives against the Discovery’s malfunctioning computer, HAL 9000. In the film’s final
            section, “Jupiter and Beyond the Infinite,” Bowman journeys into a gateway in space opened by the monolith orbiting
            Jupiter and is reborn as the next step in human evolution, the “Star Child.” Clarke wrote a novel based on the script,
            and both he and Kubrick were nominated for an Academy Award for their script. 2001: A Space Odyssey is often cited by
            film critics and historians as one of the greatest films of all time.</p> <br>
            <p>After 2001 Clarke became even more famous when he joined Walter Cronkite on CBS as a commentator for the Apollo 11 lunar
            landing, in 1969. He was one of science fiction’s leading figures, and he and American authors Isaac Asimov and Robert
            Heinlein were called the “Big Three.” He won the Nebula Award for best novella for “A Meeting with Medusa” (1971), about
            an expedition that discovers life in the clouds of Jupiter.</p><br>

            <img class="bio-image-2 animate3" src="./images/rama.jpg" alt="">
            <p>Rendezvous with Rama (1973) was another story about first contact. In the early 22nd century, a large asteroid is
            observed entering the solar system from interstellar space. Dubbed Rama, the asteroid turns out to be a cylindrical
            spacecraft, and an expedition is sent to explore its interior. Clarke’s depiction of the inscrutable mysteries of Rama
            made this one of his most popular novels, and Rendezvous with Rama won both the Hugo and Nebula awards for best novel.
            </p><br>
        </div>
            <p>Imperial Earth (1975) was a tale of cloning and solar system colonization set in the 23rd century. The Fountains of
            Paradise (1979) chronicled the construction of a space elevator on the island country of Taprobane (a fictionalized
            version of Clarke’s adopted home Sri Lanka) and won the Hugo and Nebula awards for best novel. The Songs of Distant
            Earth (1986), an expansion of a short story from 1958, was set on a distant planet whose society is disturbed by the
            arrival of the last survivors from a destroyed Earth. Clarke also wrote two sequels to 2001: A Space Odyssey during this
            time: 2010: Odyssey Two (1982, filmed 1984) and 2061: Odyssey Three (1988).</p>
            <br>
            <p>Most of his later novels were written in collaboration with other authors and with varying degrees of involvement from
            Clarke. Among them were sequels to Rendezvous with Rama (Rama II [1989], The Garden of Rama [1991], and Rama Revealed
            [1993], with Gentry Lee) and The Light of Other Days (2000, with Stephen Baxter), about a wormhole-powered technology
            that allows the viewing of past times. He did write three solo novels in this period: The Ghost from the Grand Banks
            (1990), about attempts to raise the Titanic; The Hammer of God (1993), about an asteroid on a collision course with
            Earth; and 3001: The Final Odyssey (1997), the final book in the Space Odyssey series. Clarke’s final novel, The Last
            Theorem (2008), which concerns an alien invasion and a new short proof of Fermat’s last theorem, was completed by
            Frederik Pohl.</p>
                <br>
            <p>In addition to his many collections of essays, Clarke wrote two autobiographical volumes. His scientific papers,
            including “Extra-Terrestrial Relays,” were collected in Ascent to Orbit: A Scientific Autobiography (1984). He wrote
            about the influence that the magazine Astounding Stories had on him as a young science fiction fan and later as a writer
            in Astounding Days: A Science Fictional Autobiography (1989). Clarke was knighted in 2000.</p>

            <br>
            <p>2001: A Space Odyssey, American science-fiction film, released in 1968, that set the benchmark for all subsequent movies
            in the genre and consistently ranks among the top 10 movies ever made, especially known for its groundbreaking special
            effects and unconventional narrative. The complex and thought-provoking film was directed by Stanley Kubrick and
            cowritten by Kubrick and futurist and novelist Arthur C. Clarke.</p> <br>
            <p>One of the most original works in cinema history, 2001 defies simple explanation. The opening section, “The Dawn of
            Man,” shows apes in the prehuman era discovering a strange stone monolith that appears from nowhere and then using the
            first tools. The scene subsequently switches to the future, the year 2001. A similar monolith has been found under the
            Moon’s surface and transmits a signal to Jupiter. The spacecraft Discovery, manned by astronauts Frank Poole (played by
            Gary Lockwood) and Dave Bowman (Keir Dullea), is sent to Jupiter to investigate. The middle segment of the film takes
            place on board Discovery and is perhaps the most memorable—and most straightforward. The ship’s computer, HAL 9000,
            which possesses human intellect and vocal ability, malfunctions and begins to work against the astronauts in a
            life-or-death battle of wits, leading to questions about humankind’s relationship to machines. In the film’s final
            section, “Jupiter and Beyond the Infinite,” Bowman travels through a gateway in space opened by the monolith orbiting
            Jupiter and is reborn as the “Star Child.” This section of the film is the most debated and open to interpretation,
            because conventional film narrative is suspended, and the story is told solely through images and sound.</p> <br>
            <p>Voice-activated computers, flat-screen monitors, and HAL’s ability to play chess are among the far-sighted novelties in
            the film that later became commonplace. Kubrick included extended periods without spoken conversation in the film,
            particularly in the opening and ending sections. His use of classical music instead of an original score—tapping Johann
            Strauss’s The Blue Danube waltz for his famous space station docking and lunar landing scenes and Richard Strauss’s
            dramatic Thus Spoke Zarathustra for the opening scene of the film—which depicts an alignment of the Sun, the Earth, and
            the Moon and is often called the greatest movie opening ever—only added to the uniqueness of the film.</p>
